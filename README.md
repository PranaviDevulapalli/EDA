# Mobile Price Prediction EDA

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for mobile price prediction using Python. The [dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsonali2003/mobile-price-prediction-dataset) contains mobile phone specifications and prices, and the aim is to understand the key factors influencing the price of mobile phones.

## Overview

The project analyzes the dataset to identify correlations between various features such as RAM, storage, camera quality, brand, etc., and mobile prices. By understanding these correlations, valuable insights are gained which can be used for building machine learning models for mobile price prediction.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains mobile phone specifications and their corresponding prices. It includes features like RAM, storage capacity, camera quality, brand, etc.

## Files

- **mobile_price_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the EDA.
- **dataset.csv**: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Conclusion

The EDA identified correlations between features like RAM, storage, camera quality, and brand with mobile price. These insights can be used for building machine learning models to predict mobile prices accurately.

## How to Use

To run the Jupyter notebook:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open `mobile_price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
